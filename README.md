# Intelligence Car
## develop the code of intelligence car

>- The functions of the intelligence car I designed are that the car is able to follow the black line which is put on the floor,obstacle avoidanceï¼Œand controlled by infrared remote control.

## 1.The module about "battery"
>- I use two ==batteries== to supply the intelligen car.The ==batteries== voltages are 9V.One supplies to the microcomputer,the other
supplies to the ==L298N==.
>- However,the ==battery== supplying to the microcomputer whose voltage is 9V is higher than the microcomputer's need.Hence,I have to use a module named ==LM7805== to lower the battery's voltage.
## 2.The module about "L298N"
>- We should use the ==L298N== to drive the motors used in the intelligent car because the voltage of microcomputer is enough to drive the motors but its current is so low that it can't drive the motors directly.
## 3.The module about "LM7805" 
>- For guaranteeing the stabilization about the operation about the microcomputer,I have to use ==LM7805==.The module about ==LM7805== can lower the voltage to 5V which is suitable for the operation about microcomputer as well.
## 4.The module about "tracking"
>- In order to enable the intelligent car to follow the black lines,I use the module about ==tracking==.The module I use has 4 probes,two of which are used for tracking.
## 5.The module about "HC-SR04"
>- I use ==HC-SR04== to enable the intelligent car to avoid the obstacles directly laid in the car's way.
## 6.The module about "Infrared Remote Control"
>- The idea to control the intelligent car by use the ==Infrared Remote Control== appears. 

**Let's expect the success of the intelligent car made by me.**
